## Introduction
In this project, we have developed a predictive model using various machine learning algorithms to predict IMDB movie ratings based on a variety of features. Leveraging the power of Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and other libraries, we have crafted an efficient prediction model that can provide insights into the factors influencing movie ratings.

## Features
- Data Analysis: Exploring and analyzing the IMDB dataset to understand patterns and trends.
- Data Science: Implementing various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
- Data Visualization: Visualizing the data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights.
- Feature Engineering: Engineering important features that can improve the predictive model's performance.
- Predictive Modeling: Developing a robust predictive model to forecast IMDB movie ratings accurately.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the implementation and analysis of different machine learning algorithms.
- **Scripts**: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- **Data**: Houses the IMDB dataset used for training and testing the prediction model.
